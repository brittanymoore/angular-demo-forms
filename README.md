# Angular Demo - Template-driven vs. Reactive Forms

This repo contains a working demo of two form options in angular: template-driven and reactive.

The original code for the forms comes from toddmotto.com [HERE](https://toddmotto.com/angular-2-forms-template-driven) 
and [HERE](https://toddmotto.com/angular-2-forms-reactive). I've made some minor changes from the
original.
